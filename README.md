# 🗺️ Mapty Project

This project is the **coolest and most real-world JavaScript project** so far!  
It’s designed to bring together everything learned in modern JavaScript — including functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming — while also introducing **new skills** like:

- Geolocation API usage 📍  
- Third-party libraries integration 📦  
- Planning and structuring real-world applications 🧠  

### 💡 Project Goals

- Apply core JavaScript knowledge in a meaningful context
- Learn how to **plan**, **design**, and **execute** a full project
- Improve problem-solving and decision-making during development
- Work with **real browser APIs** and **external libraries**

### 🚀 What You'll Practice

- ES6 Classes and OOP
- Event handling and DOM manipulation
- Geolocation (getting the user's current location)
- External libraries like Leaflet for interactive maps
- Storing and retrieving data with localStorage
- Application architecture and code organization
